Todo:

- check FvwmProxy
  -> configure it to show the usage?
- xinerama support
  -> nothing implemented yet
- check sound effects
  -> for FvwmEvent
     Problem: no au files on e.g. Debian
     -> other files (wave, mp3, etc)?
- how to implement usage of other cursors ...
- find systray applets for menu
- time_date script or xclock?
- restart menu entry for xclock
- thoughts about functions which use xterm (not default installed with X11)
- xosview as cpu monitor
