Todo:

- change WinOps menus
  -> the most used ops first ...
- check Key bindings
  -> which should be implemented by all means?
- check FvwmProxy
  -> configure it to show the usage?
- xinerama support
  -> nothing implemented yet
- check key bindings in menus
  -> nothing implemented yet
- check sound effects
  -> for FvwmEvent
     Problem: no au files on e.g. Debian
     -> other files (wave, mp3, etc)?
- how to implement usage of other cursors ...
- find systray applets for menu
- time_date script or xclock?
- discussion about used tools in the config
  -> xterm, xclock for example are not default installed with X
  -> should print a text to .xsession-errors which tools not installed
     but needed for proper work of the configuration?
